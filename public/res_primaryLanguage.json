My interest in coding was sparked by my love for mathematics and problem-solving. I am determined to create applications that are not only beautiful but also inclusive and accessible to all. My dream is to create mobile leisure games that make people happy, ones that anyone can play and feel successful. I believe my creativity as an artist and my expertise as a math teacher will blend seamlessly into a fulfilling career in software development.",

This was my entry test-in project for Intermediate Software Development. ",
